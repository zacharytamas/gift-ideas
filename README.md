Being the quant that I am, I've been wanting to get this to collect another dimension of health information about myself. Tracking weight, body fat percentage, BMI, steps, exercise, and altitude climbed just isn't enough, apparently.

**Purchasing:** [Withings' website](http://www.withings.com/us/blood-pressure-monitor.html) / [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Withings-Wireless-Pressure-Monitor-Android/dp/B00H43WOAK/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1413815213&sr=8-3&keywords=withings)
